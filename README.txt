How to install a Victoria 2 mod on windows (verified for windows 10):
	1. install 7zip or winrar (i use 7zip, so that is the perspective i will be writing this from)

	2. download the .zip or .rar folder of the mod you want to install

	3. right click on it and select 7zip -> extract files...

	4. in the menu that appears, select the 3 dots next to the "extract to:" text field, or you can type manually

	5. go to C(or whatever disk you have it on):\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Victoria 2\mod and click ok
		(you dont need to change any of the settings in this menu, the default are fine)

	6. Click ok in this menu and the files should be extracted to your mod folder.

	7. go to your mod folder (through the path listed in part 5) using file explorer.

	8. there should now be a folder there with the title of the mod you downloaded, open it.

	9. inside this folder should be another folder with the name of the mod and a .mod file, put both of those
		in the mod folder directly and delete the folder they were originally in (deleting the folder is not strictly necessary, 
		but i do it for organizational purposes.)

	now the mod should appear on your mods list when starting the game and work.

Tips for getting the right checksum:
	1. ensure that you have the correct version of the mod downloaded.

	2. If this fails, go to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria II\map\cache and delete everything inside this folder.

	3. If this fails, reinstall the mod.

	4. If this fails, verify your game files by going to steam and right clicking on the game, then going properties -> local files and
		hitting verify integrity of game files.

	(if you dont have the steam version, it shouldn't be a problem, but if you dont have money issues you could try buying the game on steam)

	5. if this fails, ask someone else for help if available, however if you can't get anyone or are too socially anxious just move on to the next step.

	6. if all else fails, uninstall and reinstall the game. (deleting the game manually as well as the vic2 folder in the documents\paradox interactive
		folder is the most consistently effective way to uninstall-reinstall)
