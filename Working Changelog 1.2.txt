*Reduced build time of all factories to 6 months instead of 1 year.

Poptypes:
*Readjusted Promotion in General, biggest points include:
    *Besides what is listed, the system is generally more simple and promotion is buffed.
    *Literacy's impact on promotion is buffed but suffers from diminishing returns in benefit at higher percentages.
    *Made it so that Soldiers can only demote to farmers and promote to officers.
    *Bureaucrats will naturally promote to 1%, at an accelerated rate if you fund admin 100%.
    *Officers promote to aristocrats if they are rich and demote to soldiers (or farmers if soldiers are over 5%) if they are poor or over 0.2%.
    *Clergy will promote to aristocrats if they are rich and demote to farmers if they are poor, severely nerfed demotion if they are under 4%.
    *Artisans are now poor strata, they promote to craftsmen always if there are factories available, otherise they promote to soldiers if there are less than 5% soldiers, otherwise they will demote into farmers.
    *Craftsmen only promote to clerks at the proper ratio for factories at 5% intervals, and only demote to farmers.
    *Clerks will demote to craftsmen if there is work available and they are at an improper ratio, they will demote to farmers if there is no work available and they will promote to aristocrats if they have >50% luxury needs.
    *Bureaucrats can only demote to farmers, and will do so if either they are over 2% or if they are between 1 and 2 percent and admin funding is under 50%.
    *Aristocrats will demote to either craftsmen or farmers when under 50% everyday needs (depending on if there is craftsmen work available). They will promote to either capitalists or officers at >50% everyday needs and >55% literacy depending on if there are sufficient officers or not.
    *Capitalists will demote the same way as aristocrats, and promote to officers if officers are needed and they have over 55% literacy.

*Reduced the organization and research bonuses of naval, and added a speed bonus.
*Added an assimilation idea, it buffs the rate but it will not make non-core provinces without an assim focus assimilate.

CBs:
*Added state size being assigned by an annual event that assigns cores, so you can see what size a state is.

*Made it so that uncivs may declare for take state on civilized nations.
*Made Puppeting nations allowed as long as they have under 2.5m pop.
*Made conquest CB available as long as the conquest target has less than 4 states and less than 500k pop, but always allowed when at 1 state remaining. (Establish protectorate works exactly the same way.)
*Minor conquest is available at 250k pop or less.

Tech:
*Made the base tech school 0 on all techs instead of +5, and nerfed all tech schools to be +10 instead of +15.

*Added a decision to release vassals.
*Fixed localisation for the request deoccupation decision, so you can tell which country is asking for deoccupation.
*Changed starting generals so that they are gained by event, so ai wont get the generals. (They still only appear if a player is on the nation before 1841, they're for the start of the game). Unfortunately due to the way generals by event work this means I had to get rid of the scripted 3/3 admiral.
*Fixed request deoccupation so it wont make you ask yourself if you would like to deoccupy yourself.
*Fixed SGF not having the generic parties.
*Made all ideology enabling events fire immediately upon their dates being reached on a random civilized country with a certain literacy level (depending on the ideology)

Combat:
*Nerfed navy build time inventions
*Rebalanced naval combat:

	*Battleship and ironclad eras are identical except that the battleship era ships are much stronger, and much more expensive.
	
	*For each of these eras, there is a submarine-class ship, a light-class ship, and a heavy-class ship.
	
		*For reference:
			*Dreadnoughts - Heavy
			*Battleships - Light
			*Cruisers - Submarine
			
			*Ironclads - Heavy
			*Monitors - Light
			*Commerce Raiders - Submarine
			
		*These are equal in cost within a single era and work on a "triangle-balance" system. Heavies easily beat lights, which easily beat subs, which easily beat heavies.
		
	*In the man-o-war era, the man-o-wars are better than frigates but significantly more expensive. Poorer countries can sustain frigate fleets, but if you have the money man-o-wars are simply better (Better cost to stats ratio).

	*Costs have been multiplied by 3 for the ironclad era and by two for the dreadnought era.
	
	
*Naval tech is completely changed to go along with the above rebalancing:
	*The max level for ports is now 3. Tech is adjusted to reflect this.
	*For each level of the port tech that doesnt give you a port, it gives a combat invention for that era's ships.
	*The armament column grants global navy combat bonuses.
	*The naval range column now grants throughput for clippers or steamers depending on era, and not naval range.
	*The organization column now has the range bonus too.
