EVTNAME16452;A House Divided;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16452;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall, but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.' -- Abraham Lincoln\n\nIt is over. All attempts at compromise, the efforts of decades of public discourse on the issue of slavery, have failed. This morning the congressmen from the Northern states resigned their offices, and the free states declared secession from the perpetual Union. A northern wind blows hard on our house divided.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA16452;Uh oh..;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME16251;A storm is brewing...;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16251;The American Civil war is reworked in this mod, the gist of it is that slavery can be abolished like any other government reform, however if it is abolished, the civil war will start immediately.\n\n§RIf slavery is not abolished by 1855 however, the northern states will secede as the Free States of America.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16251;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME69000;The State of the Ottoman Empire;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC69000;The Ottoman empire has been in a constant state of decline for decades. Now we have finally been pushed into only Anatolia, and need to start planning how we shall reclaim our greatness. We could either focus our efforts on reclaiming our great european empire, or on reclaiming the vast lands to the south. What direction will the Empire go next?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA69000;We shall go West. (Grants Greek & Bulgarian as accepted via decisions);;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB69000;We shall go South. (Grants Bedouin, Misri, and Caucasian as accepted via decisions);;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME69005;The Expansion of the South;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC69005;Since our conquest of Texas from Mexico, the region has been quickly integrated into the rest of the Southern states. Unfortunately, this also comes with the rebel sentiment of the South, which may lead to problems in the area in future...;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA69005;What could go wrong?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME69006;Reconstruction;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC69006;The civil war is over and many are asking for the liberation of the southern blacks by a radical reconstruction. However, many in the south are alarmed at such a prospect, and want to keep the former slaves as an underclass in the region.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA69006;We shall help these people.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB69006;The South shall be as it always has been.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME69002;The Abolition of Slavery;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC69002;After fighting the northern states, we have gone back on our promise to the southern states and have abolished slavery. This has caused massive rioting in the south. Our cabinet has two ideas of how to deal with this: either cut our losses and promise to not interfere with the southern system from this point onwards, or push for full equal rights between the races.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA69002;The South shall be as it always has been.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB69002;We shall help these people;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME69001;Province Selector;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC69001;You may build a province selector in your provinces to impart effects upon it.\n\nThis includes a powerful assimilation focus that will assimilate the province regardless of the cores there, which you can use on one state. Core states of yours will always assimilate, but the focus allows for non-core states to assimilate (and provides a bonus if you want to assimilate a core state). The rate of assimilation will be equal in both a core state with this focus and a non-core state with the focus. There is also a migration attraction focus that will make internal migrants go to the selected state, so you can get a few core pops there to begin assimilation.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA69001;I understand.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME69007;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Requests Unoccupation;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME69008;Our Request for Unoccupation has been Accepted!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC69008;Either our enemies are surrendering, or they just fucked up big time. Either way, it's a win for us! Unless that means we have to rehost.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME69010;Russian Expansionism;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC69010;Our expansionism has been known for many years, however we are now presented with a dillema. Do we focus on claiming the polish lands and people, or focus on Central Asia & the Caucuses?;
EVTOPTA69010;We will focus on the East. §G(Grants Caucasian & Kazakh as accepted by decision);
EVTOPTB69010;We will focus on the West. §G(Grants Polish as accepted by decision);
EVTNAME69011;Uncivilized Mobilization;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
