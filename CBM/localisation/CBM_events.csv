EVTNAME16452;A House Divided;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16452;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved — I do not expect the house to fall — but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.' -- Abraham Lincoln\n\nIt is over. All attempts at compromise, the efforts of decades of public discourse on the issue of slavery, have failed. This morning the congressmen from the Northern states resigned their offices, and the free states declared secession from the perpetual Union. A northern wind blows hard on our house divided.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA16452;Uh oh..;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME16251;A storm is brewing...;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16251;The American Civil war is reworked in this mod, the gist of it is that slavery can be abolished like any other government reform, however if it is abolished, the civil war will start immediately.n\n If slavery is not abolished by 1860 however, the northern states will secede as the Free States of America.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA16251;Unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME69000;The State of the Ottoman Empire;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC69000;The Ottoman empire has been in a constant state of decline for decades. Now we have finally been pushed into only Anatolia, and need to start planning how we shall reclaim our greatness. We could either focus our efforts on reclaiming our great european empire, or on reclaiming the vast lands to the south. What direction will the Empire go next?;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA69000;We shall go West. (Grants Greek & Bulgarian as accepted via decisions);;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTB69000;We shall go South. (Grants Bedouin, Misri, and Caucasian as accepted via decisions);;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME69001;The Chinese Civil War;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC69001;China has been disunited for several years now, but now that the Northern, Central, and Southern warlords have consolidated and prepared, we are now ready to reclaim our birthright! \n §R The Chinese Unification CB is now unlocked!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA69001;For China!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME69002;Sanctions!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC69002;You have been far too much of a badboy, now justice is served!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA69002;If only we had comet sense...;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME69003;Calm after the storm;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC69003;The international community is welcoming us once again after those horrid sanctions!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA69003;Thank Allah!;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME16453;Secessionist Sentiments;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC16453;Lately there has been a feeling of regional pride and abolitionism in $STATENAME$ . It is now assured that should slavery not be abolished soon, $STATENAME$ may secede in an open revolution.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
