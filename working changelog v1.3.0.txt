GLOBAL CHANGES:
*New start date, January 1st 1913 to be used as an alternative multiplayer gamemode, with tons of undocumented related changes for the start date.
*Promotion idea nerfed, the effect is now halved.
*National focuses now do not affect promotion, they are used for special effects such as increased throughput or rgo output. They are gained every other political thought tech.
*Promotion is globally buffed for each tech done in political thought, each tech is equal to having the pre-nerf promotion idea stacking on top of eachother.
*Decently increased the cost of ironclad generation ships and hugely increased the cost of dreadnought era ships.
*Removed infamy gain from most decisions that form countries or give accepted cultures, decisions that give cores on foreign countries generally still give infamy (Still cheaper than take state cbs).
*Increased base infamy reduction to -0.3 from -0.2 and made it decay equally when at war as at peace.
*Made it so you can always use the minor conquest wargoal if the target has only 1 state.
*Made it so that you can use a humilate wargoal on a target that has recently lost a war.
