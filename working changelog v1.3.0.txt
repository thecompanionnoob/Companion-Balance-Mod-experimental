v1.3.0: The Rising Sun & The Great War

GLOBAL CHANGES:

MISC:
*New start date, January 1st 1913 to be used as an alternative multiplayer gamemode, with tons of undocumented related changes for the start date.
*Improved the four checks visible on the lobby screen.
*Darkened and added a slight outline to rivers.
*Reworked nation flag gfx.

PROMOTION:
*National focuses now do not affect promotion, they are used for special effects such as increased throughput or rgo output. They are gained every other political thought tech.
*Promotion is globally buffed for each tech done in political thought.
*Promotion buffs from these techs and the idea are halved if there is over 750k pop in the province.
*Promotion is buffed in the first year to make starting bureaucrats promote faster.
*Clergymen promotion buffed and soldier promotion nerfed.
*Removed 55% literacy requirement for aristocrats to become capitalists, and added a constant 50% chance that their promotion is nullified, so the rate isn't too much.
*Allowed bureaucrats to promote well beyond 1% in colonial states so you aren't prevented from stating them because of unaccepted bureaucrats.
*Bureaucrats will now promote to 1.5% instead of 1% so if your empire contains a lot of land that is unaccepted, you won't have too low admin efficiency.

IDEAS:
*Promotion idea nerfed, the effect is now halved.

QoL/BUGFIX:
*Massively nerfed pop attraction to fascism based on revanchism (no more 90+% fascist countries due to two lost core states).
*Added the decision to remove unaccepted bureaucrats.
*Added some host decisions, and the ability for any country to select themselves as the host.
*Added gambling decisions that the host may enable within the first year.
*Added a second worldbank to better keep up with demand in situations of very high production.
*Made the changing of state sizes only apply when the target is at peace, so wargoals will no longer be invalidated mid-war.
*Made it so you can always use the minor conquest wargoal if the target has only 1 state.
*Made it so that you can use a humilate wargoal on a target that has recently lost a war.
*Removed infamy gain from most decisions that form countries or give accepted cultures, decisions that give cores on foreign countries generally still give infamy (Still cheaper than take state cbs).
*Made the grants decision check if you have the money to give people, preventing exploits. Because of a bug relating to this, grants of over 2 million are disabled for now.
*Changed the default music volume to 40% from 70%.
*Removed all factors for pops to decide on issues, this should be a major stability and performance uplift without costing much gameplay-wise.

*Reforms are now super super easy to pass.
*Laissez faire no longer caps tax to 90%.
*Made it so you can fully fund soldier pop pay under anti-military and pacifism.
*Healthcare and Education reforms are changed; they start as private and cannot be invested in but have passive positive impacts, if you go to mixed system investment is capped and positive impact is lessened, if you go to public you can invest fully but there are no more passive benefits.
*Healthcare and Education investment is also capped by technology, for healthcare chemistry tech and for education social thought tech. 
In accordance with this:

*Removed need of liquor and wine to build artillery, and increased the need of artillery and canned food. 
*Glass, lumber, liquor, wine, cement, and fabric factories no longer require machine parts.

WARGOALS/INFAMY:

*Increased base infamy reduction to -0.3 from -0.2 and made it decay equally when at war as at peace.
